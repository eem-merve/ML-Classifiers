# ML-Classifiers

This project compares several machine learning classifiers on a Cherenkov/Scintillation dataset to determine their accuracy. This study comprehensively evaluated Machine Learning (ML) models for classifying Cherenkov and scintillation photons due to neutrino interactions. All the related parameters and their combinations such as time, energy, and PMT coordinates in the detector were carefully studied. This project can provide ML-based classification methods for separating Cherenkov and scintillation photons. This study comprehensively evaluated ML models for classifying Cherenkov and scintillation photons due to neutrino interactions. Several ML models were compared in balanced and unbalanced datasets, and their accuracies were calculated. All the related parameters and their combinations such as time, energy, and PMT coordinates in the detector were carefully studied.
